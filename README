Sub-set of boost 1.52 to be included as a git submodule.

Contains the following libs: `build`, `test`, `regex`, and their dependencies.

Extracted using the binary distribution of `bcp`, compiled from boost 1.51, included
in [this zip file](http://ignum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost-binaries/1.51.0/boost_1_51_tools.zip).

As a sidenote, `bcp` sources included with boost 1.52.0 cannot be compiled with `gcc`, but
should be OK with VC++; see [this bug](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7778), which [has been fixed
in r81815](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/changeset/81815).
